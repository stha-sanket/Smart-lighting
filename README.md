### Components Used:
- Arduino Uno: Two microcontrollers used for controlling the system.
- LCD Display: Displays system status and information.
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): Senses ambient light levels.
- Bulb: Represents the lighting controlled by the system.Power Supply: Provides power to the circuit.
- Relay: Used for switching the bulb on and off.
- Button: Allows manual control of the system.
- Bluetooth Module: Enables wireless communication and control.
- Remote Control: Provides remote operation capability.
- IoT System Simulation: Demonstrates integration with other IoT systems for power monitoring.
